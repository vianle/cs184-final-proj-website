<h2 align="center">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this project, we implemented common geometric processing operations like mesh regularization (remeshing) and mesh simplification. Additionally, we worked on the union boolean operation for constructive solid geometry to join two separate meshes together into one mesh while maintaining their volumes. </p>
<hr width=100%>
















<h2 align="center">Technical Approach</h2>
<h3>Isotropic Remeshing</h3>
  <p>
    Often with free-form sculpting, meshes may contain many faces of different sizes which can lead to artifacts when undergoing other geometric processing operations. With isotropic remeshing, we aim to regularize mesh topology to contain triangles with greater uniformity in size and shape. Because we used an explicit representation for our mesh, we implemented the remeshing algorithm from Botsch & Kobbelt's paper: <a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~pere/PapersWeb/SGI/Kobbelt2.pdf">A Remeshing Approach to Multiresolution Modeling"</a> for our project. 
  </p>
  <h3>Our Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      We iterate through all the halfedge elements within the mesh and: 
      <ul>
        <li>Split all edges at their midpoint if the edges are longer than 4/3rds of target length (in our case, the average edge length: calculated by first iterating over all the edges and and averaging the lengths)</li>
        <li>Collapsed edges that were less than 4/5ths mean edge length</li>
        <li>Flipped edges to improve vertex degrees (improvement shown with smaller deviations from valence of 6 for all vertices)</li>
        <li>Tangentially smoothed surfaces via vertex relocation</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Edge splits </b>require the addition of new mesh elements as we are increasing the number of triangles within the overall mesh. In total, we added 2 faces, 3 edges, 1 vertex and 6 halfedges for each edge that was split. We then rereferenced all neighboring pointers to reflect the addition of the new elements.<br>
      <b>Edge collapse </b> required the deletion of existing mesh elements as we are decreasing the number of triangles within the overall mesh. For a given edge collapse, we delete 2 faces, 3 edges, 1 vertex, and 6 halfedges. We then reassigned neighboring pointers to reflect the deletion of old mesh elements. We also had to check for cases where we don't collapse the edge, such as when it resulted in a flipped triangle or a double plane.<br>
      <b>Edge flip </b>required many pointer reassignments. 
    </p>

  <h3>Problems We Faced</h3>
    <p>
      Edge collapse caused alot of issues for us as it behaved as expected when used by itself, however, it caused the program to segfault during remeshing. We believed the method was not correctly deleting mesh elements from their respective lists. In the end, we realized we were not reassigning pointers correctly as the "base case" that we were using was too complicated. After fixing the pointer reassignment issue within edge-collapse, our program no longer segfaulted upon remeshing. (????)
    </p>

<h3>Constructive Solid Geometry: Union</h3>
  <p>
    To set up this operation, we implemented UI interaction with the meshes. By toggling "O", we can select the entire object and move it on screen. Our implementation of the union operation requires strict ordering of meshes. To conduct this operation: select the first mesh and hit "A", then select the second mesh and hit "B", and finally hit "+" or "=" to add the two elements together. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We read a variety of papers on how to implement this section, however, most papers represent meshes implicitly. Because we represent the mesh explicitly, we had to find our own method. At a high level, we would find the intersections of the two meshes, delete the intersections, and then bridge the boundary faces left over from deleteing the intersections.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since we would be working with merging two meshes and the boundaries couldn't be traversed as expected, we decided to work with the polymesh and mesh nodes instead of the halfedge data structure.
    Given two input meshes (meshA and meshB), we output one mesh that is the union of the two meshes. First, we find the intersections between meshA and meshB, delete the faces that are within the intersection, and put them into a polymesh. Then, we add all the boundary vertices of meshA and meshB to individual lists. We then bridge these vertices together by creating triangles between two boundary vertices from meshA and the closest boundary vertex from meshB. Then, we build another triangle using two boundary vertices from meshB (one of which is from the first triangle) and a boundary vertex from meshA. We do this for all boundary vertices of meshA and meshB. Next, we add the nonboundary faces of meshA and meshB to the polymesh by creating triangles with the three vertices of each face. Then, we merge all the vertices of the polymesh. Finally, we delete meshA and meshB and return our newly built mesh.
  </p>

  <h3>Problems We Faced</h3>
  <p>
    This section was the most frustrating part of the project. We spent the longest time figuring out that the boundary faces didn't work as described in the project 2 spec since calling the vertex of the next halfedge would result in a segfault. We ended up just finding the boundary vertices and working with that instead. We also had problems with implementing the bridge precisely because of this lack of ordered traversal. We took many approaches to create our own list to traverse and to store new boundary edges we've created. Ultimately, we ended up bridging by growing our triangles with the nearest vertex since intersecting meshes, after deleting the intersection, would have vertices that were very close to each other. Our mesh is represented explicitly while most of the papers that we read used implicit representations for their meshes. We could not find many relevant resources on boolean operations for explicit mesh representations. We attended office hours and spoke to Ren who mentioned the necessity of intersection detection. We attempted to implement intersection detection: first, we found bounding boxes for the two input meshes (meshA & meshB). Next, we looped through all vertices of the two meshes and checked if they were within the opposing mesh's bounding box. We added all vertices that were in the other mesh's bounding box to an <code>intersection</code> list and all non-intersecting vertices into a <code>non-intersecting</code> list. The non-intersecting elements were then added to a new polymesh and the output was returned. The idea for this method was to return a mesh with no intersections and bridge the remaining vertices that potentially intersected with the other mesh. However, we ran into several issues:
    <ul>
      <li>The mesh disappeared entirely upon execution of the union operation. This bug was fixed by changing the way we inserted polygons into the polymesh output. </li>
      <li>The program segfaulted upon union operation. This bug is persistent and returns as a memory reallocation issue.</li>
    </ul>

  </p>

<h3>Mesh Simplification</h3>
  <p>
    Mesh simplification is especially useful in cases where high resolution meshes are unnecessary or computationally expensive to process. By simplifying the mesh and decreasing the number of polygons within a mesh, the operation aims to increase efficiency while maintaining quality similar to the input mesh. This helps with boolean operations in the case that the two meshes we want to boolean are not similar enough in terms of the number of faces near the intersection. We used Garland & Heckbert's paper on <a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/190/2016/garland97.pdf">Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics</a> algorithm for our simplification implementation. 
  </p>
  <p>
  First, we iterate through all the faces of the mesh and calculate each face's quadric error matrix which can be used to calculate the distance between the face and a point. Next, we set the quadric of the vertices by summing the quadric error of all faces surrounding the vertex. Then, we set the quadric error of the edges by summing the quadric error of both of the edge's vertices. We continue by finding the point along the edge that minimizes the quadric error and collapse edges with the smallest cost. After collapsing 20% of the triangles present in the mesh, we stop. Finally, we go back and sum up the vertex's quadric error matrix again because the neighbors have now changed as well as the neighboring edges' quadric error matrices.
  </p>
  <h3>Problems We Faced</h3>
  <p>There were virtually no problems here as most of our problems were with collapsing in the remesh algorithm.</p>

      Note that Peter maintains his relative shape while decreasing the number of polygons on his face. This makes geometric processing more efficient overall as quality is not sacrificed for efficiency.

<h2 align="center">Contributions</h2>
<p>Vi: I worked on the implementation of the remeshing and simplification algorithm. I also worked on the check for cases where the edges shouldn't be collapsed. For constructive solid geometry, I worked on implementing UI functions like moving the whole object by clicking and dragging as well as selecting meshes as mesh A and mesh B. I've also made a the bridging function between the boundary edges of two different meshes for the latter part of the union operation. I provided visuals for the writeup, slides, and videos. </p>
<p>Isabel: I worked on part of the remeshing segment of the project, particularly the edge-collapse method. I also attempted to implement intersection detection for the union boolean operation with bounding boxes. Additionally, I assembled the milestone and final videos, the slide decks for the milestone and final, as well as the websites for the milestone and final due dates.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Simplification was not initially in our proposal but we decided it may help balance the two meshes before boolean operations. Also, it was a last ditch effort to save our grade since we had the functions we needed from implemented remesh. </p>
